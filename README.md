- 👋 Hi, I’m @thatbakerface or Alex Baker if we're being ultra human-readable.
- 👀 I’m interested in systems, processes and automation - media, broadcast, radio, audio production, and how these interact with technology. Also a big fan of gin.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything... my management job in the broadcast radio industry increasingly involves the development, deployment and maintenance of technology, software and systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that empower media professionals to spend more time making great content and less time manually administering that otherwise creative process.
- 📫 Wanna chat? Slide in to my DMs @thatbakerface
